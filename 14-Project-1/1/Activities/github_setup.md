## Instructions

### Part 1: Create a GitHub account

Before creating a repository in GitHub, you must first create an account.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/ and register for an account if you do not already have one. 

	**Note**: Creating an account is free.

3. Select yourself as the owner, and then name it according to the project you're working on. For project one, you can name it "WebApp-Project". 
	- Enter a description that describes the project.
	- Ensure the repository is set to "Public" so others can see your work. 
	- Check "Add a README file"
	- Skip "Add .gitignore"
	- For license, choose "MIT License". This allows others to view your work legally.

	- Drag the file to the repository and then give a description of what you uploaded. 
	- After the file is uploaded, click 'Commit changes'. 
	
5. Once the change has been committed, it will then reflect in the repository.
